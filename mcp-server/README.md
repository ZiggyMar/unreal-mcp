# unreal-mcp-server

Node/TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Unreal Engine Blueprint
introspection **and edit** tools to an MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc).
It is a thin translator: every tool call opens a short-lived TCP connection to the
`UnrealMCPBridge` C++ editor plugin on `127.0.0.1:8765`, sends one line of JSON, reads one
line of JSON back, and reshapes it into a compact result for the model.

This process does **not** talk to Unreal directly via any engine SDK. It only speaks the
bridge's tiny line-delimited JSON protocol over a loopback TCP socket. The Unreal Editor
(with the `UnrealMCPBridge` plugin enabled) must already be running for any tool except
`unreal_ping` to return useful data; `unreal_ping` itself will simply report the connection
error if the editor/bridge isn't up.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- The `UnrealMCPBridge` plugin built and enabled in the target `.uproject`, with the
  Unreal Editor open on that project (see `../docs/M1_STATUS.md` for the current build
  status and manual steps).

## Setup

```bash
cd mcp-server
